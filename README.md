# Movie Recommendations

The Movie Recommendations project is a full-stack web application that was created by 
Jacob Authier and Abigail Tovar using React on the frontend and FastAPI on the backend.
We wanted to go above and beyond with a movie search engine and construct a 
machine learning algorithm to propose movies to users based on the movies they 
favorited on the site. The search engine was build using a third-party 
API called Movie Database and recommendations were based on the 'MovieLens 25M Dataset'.
